.NET client for Twingly Search API (previously known as Twingly Analytics API). Twingly is a blog search service that provides [a searchable API](https://app.twingly.com/blog_search?tab=documentation).

## Installation

Install via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Twingly.Search.Client/)

    Install-Package Twingly.Search.Client

## Configuration

* [Required] Set API key in the appSettings section of your config file:

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="TWINGLY_SEARCH_KEY" value="YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE"/>
</appSettings>
```

* [Optional] Set request timeout. The default timeout value is 10 seconds.

```xml
<appSettings>
  <add key="TWINGLY_TIMEOUT_MS" value="REQUEST_TIMEOUT_IN_MILLISECONDS"/>
</appSettings>
```

* Alternatively: Set these settings in the environment variables. The settings are first read from configuration, then from the environment variables.

## Example usage

Fetch docs about "Slack" published since yesterday. Limit results to 10 posts.

```cs
Query theQuery = QueryBuilder.Create("Slack page-size:10")
                                    .StartTime(DateTime.UtcNow.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromDays(1)))
                                    .Build();

ITwinglySearchClient client = new TwinglySearchClient();
// identify your company by setting the user agent.
client.UserAgent = "Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory";

QueryResult matchingDocs = client.Query(theQuery);
foreach (var post in matchingDocs.Posts)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Title: '{0}', Date: '{1}', Url: '{2}'",
    post.Title, post.Published, post.Url);
}
```

### Exception handling

Exceptions are organized into the following hierachy:
* `RequestException` - base class for any Twingly-related exception
  * `AuthException` - thrown when the provided key does not have access to the API
  * `QueryException` - thrown when there is something wrong with the parameters or the query sent to the API
  * `ServerException` - thrown when service is not available
* `ApiKeyNotConfiguredException` - thrown when an API key was not found in the config file

## Requirements

* API key, [sign up](https://www.twingly.com/try-for-free) via [twingly.com](https://www.twingly.com/) to get one
* .NET Framework v4.5.2 or Mono 5.0

## Development

### Code coverage

It is possible to check the code coverage by using the tool [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover).

Prerequisites:

* Install the [OpenCover binary](https://github.com/opencover/opencover/releases) or get it via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/opencover)
* Install the [Visual Studio extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6950a046-8919-4935-8542-c6f37956f688)

To use the tool:

1. Open the window `OpenCover Test Explorer`
1. Group by `Project`
1. Right-click `Twingly,Search.Tests` and select `Cover with OpenCover`
1. Open the window `OpenCover Results` to inspect the outcome

Note: The first time you use the Visual Studio extension you will need to give it the path to the OpenCover binary which is typically installed at: `%localappdata%\Apps\OpenCover\OpenCover.Console.exe`

### Release

A NuGet package is automatically generated on each build, using handy [automation scripts by Daniel Schroeder](https://newnugetpackage.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=NuGet%20Package%20To%20Create%20A%20NuGet%20Package%20From%20Your%20Project%20After%20Every%20Build&referringTitle=Home).

1. Bump the version and update the release notes in `Twingly.Search.Client\_CreateNewNuGetPackage\Config.ps1`
1. Bump the `AssemblyVersion` and `AssemblyFileVersion` in `Twingly.Search.Client\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs`
1. Commit the changes
1. Tag the current commit with the same version number and push it
1. Build the project `Twingly.Search.Client` in release mode
  * The `.nupkg` file is placed in the `Twingly.Search.Client\bin\Release` directory
1. Run `Twingly.Search.Client\_CreateNewNuGetPackage\RunMeToUploadNuGetPackage.cmd`
1. Point it to the `.nupkg` file
